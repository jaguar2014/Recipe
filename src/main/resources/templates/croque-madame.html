<h1>Croque Madame</h1>
France
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>â…” cup milk</li>
<li>Sea salt</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>4 1/3-inch-thick slices country bread</li>
<li>4 thin slices French ham</li>
<li>2 thin slices Gruyere cheese</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Preheat a two-sided electric griddle on medium-high to high for about 20 minutes, or preheat the oven to 300 degrees and preheat a cast-iron skillet on top of the stove for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Prepare a bechamel sauce: in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter.</p>
<p>When bubbles have subsided, add flour and whisk vigorously for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Slowly whisk in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil, and cook until thick.</p>
<p>Remove from heat, and season to taste with salt and nutmeg.</p>
<p>Spread two slices of bread generously with sauce.</p>
<p>Lay two slices of ham on top of each, and top each with a slice of cheese; ham and cheese should slightly overlap edges of bread.</p>
<p>Top each with a slice of bread.</p>
<p>In a small saucepan, melt remaining the 4 tablespoons butter.</p>
<p>Brush the sandwiches on both sides with butter, making sure that the edges are well covered. If you're using a griddle, place cheese side down, close the griddle and cook until the bread is toasted dark and cheese is leaking out and bubbling.</p>
<p>If you're using a skillet, place sandwiches cheese side down and cook on stove top until well browned, then turn and brown again.</p>
<p>Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until heated through and cheese is bubbling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fry the eggs in a skillet with little butter. Slide one fried egg onto each sandwich.</p>
<p>Serve hot.</p>
